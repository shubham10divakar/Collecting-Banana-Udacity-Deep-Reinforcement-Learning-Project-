## Learning algorithm

The learning algorithm used is vanilla Deep Q Learning as described in original paper. As an input the vector of state is used instead of an image so convolutional neural nework is replaced with deep neural network. The deep neural network has following layers:

Parameters used in my deep q learning algorithm:

- Maximum steps per episode: 1000
- Starting epsilion: 1.0
- Ending epsilion: 0.01
- Epsilion decay rate: 0.999
